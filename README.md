# Bootstrapper
A personal bootstrap script for my new systems.

## Purpose
This works in tandem with my dotfiles repo when run on a new system. It will detect the current OS and instal the relevant packages and applications needed, as well as pull down my dotfiles.

## Usage
On a new system you should wget/curl bootstrap.sh, chmod +x it, and run it as sudo.
